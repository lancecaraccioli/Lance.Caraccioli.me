Markdown ~~WYSIWYG~~ [1](/#/blog/markdown "Removed By Copywriter")
==================================================================

Remember FCKeditor?
-------------------
Ah yes the classic WYSIWIG FCKeditor. The good ol' ~~pull my hair out~~ days. Manually fixing all the
ghost HTML created by the tool that was suppose strip content 'paste(d) from word' to allow Copywriters the ability to
quickly change their own content without the need for Engineering efforts (breath, that was a mouthful).
Thankfully Engineers fixed all that nonsense... right? Answer: Yes and No. Amazingly the more recent incarnation
of FCKeditor, [CKeditor](http://ckeditor.com/), while better than it's predecessor, still suffers from the same
fundamental flaws. The entropy (complexity / messiness) of the underlying source HTML still tends to increase as edits
are made. Luckily a much better technology is available; Markdown.

Markdown in a Nutshell
----------------------
Its common place these days to see [Markdown][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown] (*.md files)
in almost any [git](http://git-scm.com/) repository. [GitHub](http://github.com), while not the first to use Markdown,
certainly added to it's popularity by adopting a [flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)
of Markdown used to render *.md files in the browser to improve User experience. But Markdown is more than a convenient documentation
syntax. By design it's intended goal was to provide a writing syntax which was "easy-to-read, easy-to-write" and easily
converted into HTML.

Enter Our Copywriters
-----------------------
Most Copywriters I've worked with are familiar with Markdown. In any case it's easy to learn and Copywriters new to Markdown
generally pick it up in a day. It's certainly easier to read and write and requires very little knowledge, if
any, about html. What they still need however is a robust, real-time mechanism for updating
Markdown based content. These types of features typically take lower priority living out their existence in the back log.
The classical perspective is that Copywriters produce the words, while Front-End Engineers update the source code.
I think we can improve upon this. I believe we collectively become more efficient by placing power tools in the hands of Copywriters.
Initially Copywriters will have more freedom and agility allowing them to experiment more often and remain on task
instead of waiting for Engineering cycles to become available. Likewise Engineering cycles otherwise required to make changes
to static content can instead be spent on higher value items.

General Thoughts
----------------
In general I believe we Engineers should remind ourselves to keep in mind that the next feature may or may not be more valuable
than empowering our coworkers with better tools and automation.
